MIDI In/Out/Thru For stuff
========================================

SF design suffers from a few problems, like   
* the PROG/RUN jumper : non here, connect your micro to software serial. or whatever  
* the uno formfactor: we are over(under) it, design is for ruggedness  
* 0402 footprint - no need for the tiniest parts. we use thru hole a lot here beaucse anyways the midi sockets are big.  
  
this is a fork, you know
